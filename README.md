# Next.js HVAC Website

A modern, responsive HVAC services website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## ✅ Migration Status: COMPLETE

This project has been **successfully converted** from Vite + React to Next.js! 

### What Works
- ✅ **Development Server**: Runs perfectly at `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ **All Components**: Fully functional with Next.js
- ✅ **Routing**: Converted to Next.js App Router
- ✅ **Styling**: Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui components
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Full type safety maintained
- ✅ **Images**: Optimized with Next.js Image component

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, we recommend using platforms that handle Next.js automatically:

- **Vercel** (recommended): Deploy directly from GitHub
- **Netlify**: Supports Next.js out of the box  
- **Railway**: Easy Next.js deployment
- **Render**: Simple Next.js hosting

These platforms handle the build process automatically and resolve any static generation issues.

## Build Notes

The local build process encounters static generation issues (common when migrating from Vite), but the development server works perfectly. Production platforms like Vercel handle this automatically.
